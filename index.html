            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>this site is a neat little place i can post whatever i want, whenever i want, however i want without anything getting lost, attacked, hidden by algorithms, or anything else</p>
            <p>this is where you will find the rawest of my works - and a general collection of as much of my work i can scrape together from the various other platforms i utilise currently</p>
            <p>the goal of this site is not to replace my other socials, at least not anytime soon - instead it is to compliment them as an online gallery of sorts. a window into my odd mind</p>
            <p>enjoy your stay :3</p>

              like what you see here ? be sure to check out my socials at 
              <span onclick="window.location.href = './contact.html';" class="font-link">contact</span>
              where you can reach out with suggestions, feedback, and if you are feeling generous you can support me so that i may continue my work <3
